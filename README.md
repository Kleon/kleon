> I’m a Mechanical Engineer with a strong background in materials science, data analytics, and computational modeling. My work combines hands-on engineering with data-driven analysis, using tools like Python, SQL, and JMP to monitor system performance and support decision-making in high-tech environments.

>Currently, I work at Intel as a Module Engineer, supporting Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) processes for 18A.

>I'm particularly interested in the intersection of physical engineering, materials behavior, and computational tools, where I can apply both analytical thinking and technical skills to solve complex, real-world problems.

## Current Projects

- **Jet-Impingement Cooled MacBook**: A custom cooling pad designed for my aging MacBook Pro using jet impingement cooling for enhanced thermal performance. Inspired by Apple’s design philosophy and Jony Ive’s focus on simplicity and user experience, the project blends engineering functionality with a sleek, consumer-ready aesthetic. Designed and fabricated end-to-end to resemble a real Apple product.
